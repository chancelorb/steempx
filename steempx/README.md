## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

## Title: Escape-Room

## Project Overview
This a game where the player will try to escape from a locked room by looking for clues, solving puzzles and playing minigames.
The player will be able to examine items and navigate through the room or house

## Wireframes

Include links to the images of your wireframes.

## Priority Matrix

Include a link to your full the `Time\Priority` Matix.  

## MVP

Include a bulleted list of the features that will be part of your MVP

## POST MVP

Include a bulleted list of the features that will be part of POST MVP


## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous game phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Component 1 | H | 10hrs| 12hrs | 12hrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description |
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string |

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project.

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  

## Change Log
 Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.  

## Issues and Resolutions
 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

#### SAMPLE.....
**ERROR**: app.js:34 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier                                
**RESOLUTION**: Missing comma after first object in sources {} object
