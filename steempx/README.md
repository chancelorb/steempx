## Project Description

My final project will be a mx of [Steemit](steemit.com) and [500px](https://500px.com/)/[Pinterest](https://pinterest.com/).
In this case I will cut out the middle man 500px/Pinterest and reward the content creator directly with Steem tokens which are ease to exchange for bitcoin, dollars or other coins.

## Title: Steempx

## Project Overview
This is a platform where photographers can look for inspiration and share there pictures. Because of steems "proof-of-brain" protocol the creator gets rewards via likes and/or donations.

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous game phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Component 1 | H | 10hrs| 12hrs | 12hrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description |
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string |

## Additional Libraries
